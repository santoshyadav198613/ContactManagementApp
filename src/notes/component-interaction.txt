What is component interaction:
The way to communicate between multiple components.

How:
1. html
    a.  @Input() - when we want to pass data to child component.
    b.  @Output() - when we want to receive the data from child component.
        EventEmitter-- to create a custom event
        $event -- to be used in function in parent component
2. typescript
    1. ViewChild -- To get access to the first html tag.   
    2. ViewChildren  -- To get access to all the tags of similar type.  
3. services
